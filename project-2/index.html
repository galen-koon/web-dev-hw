   <h1>Why Wax Skis Yourself?</h1>
   <p>
     Waxing your skis is important for a <i>number</i> of reasons, but most notibly to increase <i>performance</i> and increase the <i>longevity</i> of the ski. Though many shops offer the services for a <b>fee</b>, why not just do the work yourself? You will save money, time, and will become <i>better connected</i> to your skis.
     The process is a simple one that shouldn't take longer than forty minutes, which is probably less time than a shop would have you wait anyway. There is an <b>initial investment</b> for all of the materials, but they will quickly pay themselves off compared to what you would spend in a shop.

   <h2>Materials</h2>
  <p>
    There are a number of materials that you will need to purchase in order to successfully wax your skis at home. It is also a good idea to have a nice workspace, ideally somewhere that can get messy.
