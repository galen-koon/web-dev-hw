   <h1>Why Wax Skis Yourself?</h1>
   <p>
     Waxing your skis is important for a <i>number</i> of reasons, but most notibly to increase <i>performance</i> and increase the <i>longevity</i> of the ski. Though many shops offer the services for a <b>fee</b>, why not just do the work yourself? You will save money, time, and will become <i>better connected</i> to your skis.
     The process is a simple one that shouldn't take longer than an hour, which is probably less time than a shop would have you wait anyway. There is an <b>initial investment</b> for all of the materials, but they will quickly pay themselves off compared to what you would spend in a shop.

   <h2>Materials</h2>
  <p>
    There are a number of materials that you will need to purchase in order to successfully wax your skis at home. It is also a good idea to have a nice workspace, ideally somewhere that can get messy.
  </p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>A pair of skis with which to get rowdy on</li>
    <li>Wax that is ideal for the current weather conditions</li>
    <li>An iron. Ideally one that is made for wax but a clothes iron will do fine</li>
    <li>A ski waxing brush</li>
    <li>A scraper, metal or plastic</li>
    <li>A soft, dry rag</li>
    <li>A work bench with vice grips</li>
    <li>Two strong rubber bands</li>
  </ul>

 <div id="Procedure" class="container behind-text padded">
   <h2>Procedure</h2>
   <p>
     Waxing skis shouldn't take more than an hour, which includes an <i>ideal</i> half-hour wait time for the wax to cool. This time is recommended but you can certainly wait less time.
   </p>
  <ol>
   <li>Waxing your skis should be done after all other work, such as base welds, edge tunes, etc.</li>
   <li>Clean the base of the skis with your soft rag. Get all moisture, dirt, rust, grime, or anything else off of there. Follow this up with the brush, running it the length of the skis, and then do one more passover with the rag.</li>
   <li>Turn your iron on and let it warm up. This should be around 250 degrees fahrenheight.</li>
   <li>Secure one of your skis in the vice grips so that the base faces up. Use one of the rubber bands to hold back the brakes so that they are not protruding over the base.</li>
   <li>Pick your wax that is suited for the current conditions, and press it to the iron, so that the wax drips down onto the base of the ski. Drip wax down the base so that it runs the length of the ski. It is not necessary to drip over every inch of base, there will be some gaps.</li>
   <li>Run the iron over the base, heating up the wax and spreading it around to cover the entire base.</li>
   <li>Let the wax cool for a half-hour. During this cooling process, repeat steps 1-6 with the other ski.</li>
   <li>When your first ski is cool, lay it back down in the vice grips. Use your metal or plastic scraper to scrape the wax off, going from tip to tail. You should do this until it seems that not much more wax will come off.</li>
   <li>Use your brush to brush down the ski, going from tip to tail. This is to help groove the wax and make it more suitable for snow.</li>
   <li>Take your rubber band off the brakes.</li>
   <li>Repeat steps 7-10 for the second ski.</li>
   <li>You are done! Go shred the gnar!</li>
