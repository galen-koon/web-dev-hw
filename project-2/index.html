   <h1>Why Wax Skis Yourself?</h1>
   <p>
     Waxing your skis is important for a number of reasons, but most notibly to increase performance and increase the longevity of the ski. Though many shops offer the services for a fee, why not just do the work yourself? You will save money, time, and will become better connected to your skis.
     The process is a simple one that shouldn't take longer than forty minutes, which is probably less time than a shop would have you wait anyway. There is an initial investment for all of the materials, but they will quickly pay themselves off compared to what you would spend in a shop.
