# Readme for Project 2

## Recap of html
This was interesting to learn because I had never worked with it before, but I definitely struggled with some things. I enjoyed it though because it is very applicable in the real world and something that I definitely should know how to do.

### Excited to learn...
I am excited to learn CSS because I feel like none of my web pages are very interesting as of now, and this will give me some pizazz to spice things up a bit and make them more viewable.

#### Work cycle
I did use the issues board in order to get help with the contact form. I did not understand the action element but Justine was able to answer my question and I was able to complete the project.
