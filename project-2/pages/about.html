   <h2>About the Author</h2>
   <p>
     Galen Koon lives in Missoula, Montana, with his four roommates and goes to school at the University of Montana. He is currently a junior
     in the Journalism and Media Arts programs. He enjoys skiing, rafting, hiking, photography, videography, and film. He first learned about ski waxing back
     in high school, when he was on the racing team. He used to need to wax his skis before every race, but didn't want to pay for a shop to do it, so he learned
     how to do it himself.
   </br>
   I chose to share this activity with the class because I really enjoy it and it is something very practical that people can learn quickly and easily. This is very applicable to Missoula, because we have so many skiers, and I wanted to hopefully help some people out.
 </br>
 More information can be found almost anywhere, though it is not a complicated process. I really like LB Snow on Spruce St. for doing work to my skis that I don't want to do myself, and I'm sure they would love to help you out if you are struggling.
