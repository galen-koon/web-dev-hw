      <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
      <p>
        [Intro]
Reefer
Ya know, reefer madness
A city starved of fame, it’s the same old thang
Yes, lean with me, rock with me
Golden sodas, one to stock, one to rock
Yes it’s here that we announce this day of freedom
Charles Bronson, signing out
Here we go
</br>
</br>
[Verse 1]
I grew up on the East side, the Miami Beach side
Deep fried in greed life, clam bakes by the seaside
Tan legs wearing knee highs, sand shakes off them sweet thighs
Back in 99 when I was silver spoon fed
Pops had the Porsche, dollin’ out the bread
Johns on the salsa, gun against his head
I got divorced ya, cold as a corpse
But there ain’t enough stamps in your passport for this crash course
I passed the class, now let's fast forward
Blast from the grass out on the back porch
Cash in the dash, I went straight to the source
Quarts, call them escorts
I’ve been moving bodies like I’m using the force
Floating down the river like a water resort
</br>
</br>
[Interlude]
Never coming back, never coming back
Magic City stuck in my head
</br>
</br>
[Hook]
Holding out for the Hollywood bride
My tongue gets heavier later on in the night
Here’s another one for the dinner plate eyes
My tongue gets heavier later on in the night
Holding out for the Hollywood life
My tongue gets heavier later on in the night
Here's another one for the children of the times
My tongue gets heavier later on in the night
</br>
</br>
Tenacity, Susan
[?]
(My tongue gets heavier)
I'm in love with you
It's a real love
I know it
When I'm with you
It feels like I'm walking on electric air
