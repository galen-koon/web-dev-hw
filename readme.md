# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.
## Galen S. Koon

I am taking this class for a few different reasons. First and foremost, it is required for my major. I am double majoring in Media Arts and Journalism, and this is one of the required courses for the BA Online Media Arts program. Secondly, I am interested in the basics of web development, and though I don't see myself doing it as a career, would like to know the basics and have the abilities to create a website for myself.

* The internet concept started with a project for the department of defense, with the hope of creating a communications network that could withstand a nuclear attack.
* The internet is a mixture of server hosts and clients. The hosts, such as ISPs, are able to connect directly to the internet, whereas clients, such as myself, need to tap into a host's connection in order to be able to access the internet.
* The internet is made up of websites that use HTML code in order to display their content. They can also include other types of code to help distinguish or enhance their webpage, such as CSS or Javascript.
